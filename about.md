Hello there, my name is Felipe Moreno, I'm Colombian and i study systems engineering at the National University of Colombia.

I'm 22 years old and I'm in my fifth year at the University, I've learned a bunch of stuff but I'm mostly interested in
front-end development and visual applications.

My favorite programming languages are:

- Ruby
- Python
- JavaScript
- HTML

I've used the frameworks Ruby on Rails and Angular and I'm quite comfortable with them.

I've also worked with languages like:

- ANTLR for language recognition.
- Processing3 for small visual applications.
- Typescript because sometimes JavaScript can be tricky.
- C++ because sometimes you wanna play god.
- Assembler for programming a TI-MSP430 LaunchPad.
- SQL for database stuff.
- Java i dont like it that much.
- VisualBasic for Microsoft macros and other stuff.
- GPSS for modelation.
- MatLab for convolutional neural networks and signal manipulation.


## Some "big" group projects

### An application for book publications

As a project for the subject _Software Engineering 2_, me and some friends made a little system to manage the
process of book publication in the Engineering Faculty at the National University of Colombia, it was made using the
framework **Ruby on Rails** for the back-end and **Angular2** for the front-end, it has LDAP authentication wich the
University uses for logging in any of it's applications, and some other cool stuff.

- Go to repo [Catalogo de Publicaciones Facultad de Ingenieria](https://github.com/CatalogoPublicacionesIngenieriaUnal/catalogoPublicaciones).

### An application for light control

For the subject _Software Architecture_ we did a simple application that would ideally control the lights of a house
from a web application, it was more a project to understand software architectures and design than an exercise of software
development. It was made using **Ruby on Rails** for the back-end and **Angular2** for the front-end, we also used **Docker**
for building and running the application.

- Go to back-end repo [ILlumination Backend](https://github.com/illuminationSA/Backend).
- Go to front-end repo [ILlumination Frontend](https://github.com/illuminationSA/Frontend).

## Other

### Levenshtein distance implementation

I needed to compare a couple hundred text strings so i made, with the help of a friend, a **Ruby** implementation of the
Levenshtein distance algorithm so it could use two _CSV_ files and return list of the most _"similar"_ string from the second file.

- Got to repo [StrComp](https://github.com/anfmorenoso/strcomp).

## More Information

Besides programming i also love a big load of other stuff like:

### Music

I've always said that i'm better listening to it than making it but I'm actually trying to learn to play the Ukuelele,
besides that i took some keyboard and guitar classes when i was like 10 years old.

On the other hand, i like to listen to a **lot** of music genres and I'm always looking for some new music and i try
to listen before i say no to it. My favorite genres are:

- Indie
- Alt Rock
- PostRock

And my favorite bands are:

- Radiohead
- The Strokes
- Keane

If you want, you can check out my _Spotify_ lists [here](https://open.spotify.com/user/12161509218).

### Cinema

When it comes to movies I'm a little more judgy, even when my favorite movie is _V For Vendetta (2005)_ which is not
the best movie in the entire world when it comes to direction, or photography or even script, however it brings a lot
of strong emotions that i can't resist.

I'm in love with Tarantino's movies, i think they are awesome to describe this weird world we live in. Finally a little
list of great _must-see_ movies:

- Pulp Fiction (1994)
- The Godfather parts I and II (1972 - 1974)
- Inception (2010)
- Sin City (2005)
- Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy (2005 - 2008 - 2012)
- Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)
- La la land (2016)
- Fight Club (1999)
- Django Unchained (2012)
- Taxi Driver (1976)

### Photography

As the little caption below my name says, i'm kind of a photography aficionado, i love taking pictures, specially
landscapes, but i'm not afraid to experiment into other aspects like architecture and sometimes even portrait or timelapses

You can check out my _Instagram_ and _Flickr_ profiles in the footer links.

### Languages

Lately I've discovered a certain interest in languages, English isn't even my "first" language, as a Colombian i speak Spanish
but i've been learning English for the last 8 years mostly by myself. I'm currently learning French at my University, its a
extremely beautiful language but it's really hard, specially because of all the modes and verbal tenses, on the other side it's
actually pretty organized and have a lot of similar vocabulary to Spanish and English so it's not the end of the world.
